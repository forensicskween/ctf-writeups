# üöÄ Methodology

  

### üîé 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Cryptosystem

The cryptosystem uses a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) defined as follows:

$$\text{Initial seed:} \quad x_0 \in \mathbb{Z}_p$$

$$x_{n+1} \equiv a x_n + b \pmod{p}, \quad \text{for } n \geq 0$$

--- 

We're given:
- A 254-bit **prime** modulus
- Constants $a$ and $b$
- Two truncated outputs: $hint_1$ and $hint_2$

The internal values are computed via:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_n &= a x_{n-1} + b \\
x_{n+1} &= a x_n + b \\
h_n &= \left( x_n \cdot x_{n+1}^{-1} \right) \bmod p
\end{aligned}
$$


Or more consisely:

$$h_n = \left( \dfrac{x_n}{x_{n+1}} \right) \bmod p$$


The challenge discards the lowest 48 bits of each $h_n$‚Äã :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{hint}_n &= \left\lfloor \frac{h_n}{2^{48}} \right\rfloor
\end{aligned}
$$



### ‚ö° 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Vulnerabilities

The core of this challenge relies on **modular arithmetic over finite fields**, specifically over the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$.

- The values $h_1$ and $h_2$ are elements of the group $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$.  In this group, every nonzero element has a **multiplicative inverse**, which makes operations like division (i.e., modular inverses) well-defined.
- The LCG forms a **linear recurrence** over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. This means that each $x_n$ is a polynomial in the intial seed, $x_0$ (in other words - the padded flag). 

The key vulnerability is information leakage:

- The hints leak most of the bits of $h_1$ and $h_2$, ~206 out of 254 bits of information per hint. That‚Äôs an **enormous leak**.

- The unknowns are in the least significant bits, and the truncation to 48 bits means the actual space of uncertainty is just $2^{48}$, which is small relative to the 254-bit modulus.

- We also know that the initial seed is 30 bytes long and starts with b'HTB{'; which gives us an additional ~32 known bits.


We can start by defining our polynomials in SageMath:

```python

poly.<x,lsb_1,lsb_2> = PolynomialRing(GF(p))

H1 = (hint1 << 48) + lsb_1
H2 = (hint2 << 48) + lsb_2
X = b2l(b'HTB{' + bytes(26)) + x

gen = lcg(X,a,b)

poly_h1 = next(gen) - H1 * next(gen)
poly_h2 = next(gen) - H2 * next(gen)

```

This produces two bivariate polynomials that share a common root in $x$. 

### üî® 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploiting the Weakness

Given the challenge's name it's obvious we are expected to use Coppersmith's small roots method. However, solving directly with poly_h1 and poly_h2 is infeasible. This is because there aren't enough known bits of $x$. 

But, the two polynomials share a common root in $x$, therefore we can eliminate the seed variable $x$ using a resultant, which will give us a bivariate polynomial in $lsb_1$ and $lsb_2$. 

To do that, we can convert the polynomials to the Integer Ring and calculate the resultant polynomial, and map it back to our original PolynomialRing. 

*Side note: Defund's Coppersmith implementation will check that the number of variables in the polynomial are equal to the number of variables of the Polynomial Ring, therefore we will need to remove variable x from the Polynomial Ring before applying the small roots method* 

```python

poly_h1_zz = poly_h1.change_ring(ZZ)
poly_h2_zz = poly_h2.change_ring(ZZ)

poly_resultant = poly_h1_zz.resultant(poly_h2_zz)

poly = poly.remove_var(x)
poly_resultant = poly(poly_resultant)

```

### üîë 4Ô∏è‚É£ Recovering the Flag


Now we have a bivariate polynomial with **small roots**: both $lsb_1$ and $lsb_2$ are less than $2^{48}$. This is exactly the kind of problem that **Coppersmith‚Äôs method** solves.

I used [defund‚Äôs Coppersmith implementation](https://github.com/defund/coppersmith/blob/master/coppersmith.sage):

```python

bounds = (2**48,2**48)
roots = coppersmith.small_roots(poly_resultant,bounds)
print(roots[0])

```
The roots:
```python

# (53006259096585, 248699398699637)

```
Substituting them back in our original polynomials to get the LSB of $x$:
```python

poly_x1 = poly_h1.subs(lsb_1=roots[0][0]).univariate_polynomial().monic()
poly_x2 = poly_h2.subs(lsb_2=roots[0][1]).univariate_polynomial().monic()

assert poly_x1 == poly_x2

x = poly_x1.roots()[0][0]

flag = b'HTB{' + l2b(int(x))
print(flag)

#HTB{sm1th1ng_mY_c0pp3r_fl4G}L\xc6
```

**üö© Final Flag:**  `HTB{sm1th1ng_mY_c0pp3r_fl4G}`
